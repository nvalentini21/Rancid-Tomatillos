## How To Use Rancid Tomatillos:

Immediately upon running `npm start`, a react application should open in your web browser, and load the movies dashboard. The dashboard contains all movies included in the api database. Users can click on a movie poster, and be directed to a new page that shows the movie's specific details.

The individual movie page contains the following movie information: Movie title, runtime, release date, genres, overview, average rating, revenue, and budget.

* Users can navigate back to the main page by clicking on the 'All Movies' button in the navigation section at the top right hand corner.

### Search Movies :

A user is able to search for a specific movie by doing the following:

* click the "Search Movies" button in the navigation section at the top right hand corner of the screen.

* the user will be directed to a form, in which they can begin to type the movie title into the input. Movies that contain the input will automatically populate in the field below.

## Features

* Fetching and displaying data from an API/local server in a visually appealing way.
* Utilizing react router to create multiple pages/urls that allow the user to use the browser back and forward buttons.
* Using a form/input field to filter through a database and display matches based on the input value, in real time.
* Error handling for server errors, so that the user can easily understand when a network request has failed.

## Future Additions

The current project represents the completion of the a Turing School of Software and Design Module 3 solo project.

In the future, I plan to:

* Deploy this project via Heroku or surge for more accesible viewing.
* Add icons for the overall app title, and individual movie ratings.
* Add a loading page/icon to be shown while network requests are taking place.
* Add a trailer link to the single movie pages that can be viewed.
* Add a randomized video section at the top of the dashboard, that will highlight a trailer from a random movie each time the page is loaded.
* Continue to add additional layers of error handling - instead of a window alert, I'd like to make some of the messages appear on the page.
